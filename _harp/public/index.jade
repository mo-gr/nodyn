  h1 Nodyn

  :markdown
    Nodyn is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) compatible framework, running on
    the JVM powered by the [DynJS](http://dynjs.org) Javascript runtime with an
    embedded [Vert.x](http://vertx.io) - the polyglot application platform and
    event bus.

    Imagine running your Node.js app on the JVM with clean, clear access
    to Java directly in your Javascript.  All that with vert.x's powerful
    clustering technology built right in.
